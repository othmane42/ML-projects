<h1>Plant disease detection</h1>
plant disease is one of the main problems in the agriculture that need to be tackled and may cost a lot <br>
in order to tackle this problem , AI can be a great tool to solve this problem with tests for early diagnosis using CNN <br>
this [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/saroz014/plant-diseases) was used to train and evaluate the model<br>
I used keras and took advantage of transfer learning for faster training (architecture used : [VGG16](https://keras.io/applications/#vgg16))
